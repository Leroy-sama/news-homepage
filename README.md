Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<picture>
	<source
		media="(min-width: 768px)"
		srcset="./assets/images/image-web-3-desktop.jpg"
	/>
	<img src="./assets/images/image-web-3-mobile.jpg" alt="" />
</picture>
```

```css
.container {
	margin-inline: auto;
	width: min(90%, 73em);
}
```
